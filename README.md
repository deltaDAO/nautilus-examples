# Nautilus Examples

A TypeScript project showing [Nautilus](https://github.com/deltaDAO/nautilus) usage examples in different configurations.

## Quick start:

1. Install node modules:
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
2. Setup the `.env` file:

   ```sh
   cp ./example.env ./.env
   ```

   Fill in variables in `.env`:

   | Variable    | Value                                                           |
   | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | NETWORK     | `mumbai` or `pontusx` or `oasis_pontusx`                                         |
   | PRIVATE_KEY | private key of your account (you can export this from MetaMask) |

   > The account needs to be funded with tokens. Depending on the example and network either `matic` (`mumbai`) or `gx` (`pontusx`) for the network fees and `EUROe` or `OCEAN` for paid services.

3. Uncomment and adjust functions you want to test:

   Go into the `index.ts` file and look for the ℹ️ in the `main()` function. You can uncomment the functions you want to test and save the file.

4. Start the script:

   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```
